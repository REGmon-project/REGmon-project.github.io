Getting Started
======================================

[under construction]

Once you have followed the `Installation Guide <https://regmon-project.github.io/installation.html>`_, you can start using the REGmon.
This section will guide you through the first steps.

===============
Access REGmon
===============

You can access REGmon by typing the URL of your REGmon instance into your browser.
If REGmon is initialized locally the default is ``localhost:8000``.
If REGmon is set up on a web-server, you may access the web-application by typing the URL of your web-server adding the "Application Domain name" you have set during the installation process.

======================
Preconfigured profiles
======================

If you decided to import sample data (`see section "Admin Login" <https://regmon-project.github.io/installation.html#admin-login>`_) there are several users profiles created besides the main admin profile.
All of them have the initial password set the same as the password for the main admin profile.

These are the preconfigured profiles:

* "LocationAdmin" - user with the role "location admin"
* "GroupAdmin" - user with the role "group admin"
* "GroupAdmin2" - user with the role "group admin (reduced)"
* "Trainer1" - user with the role "trainer"
* "Athlete1" - a first user with the role "athlete"
* "Athlete2" - a second user with the role "athlete"
